16-745 Course Project: Comparing Collision Avoidance between Control Barrier Functions and Trajectory Optimization with Constraints

Architecture Adapted from Examples Provided in:<br>
*16-645: Optimal Control and Reinforcement Learning*
- fmincon.jl taken directly from OCRL HW3 (Original Author: Kevin Tracy (https://github.com/kevin-tracy))
- traj-opt architecture adapted from HW3 for our use case
- DI_CBF: control barrier function implemented with double integrator dynamics
- DiffDriveCBF: Attempted control barrier function implemented with diff drive dynamics
- CBF: adapted reference CBF implementation code (Original Author: Kevin Tracy (https://github.com/kevin-tracy))
